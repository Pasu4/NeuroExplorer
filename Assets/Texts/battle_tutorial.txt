A battle has started. To survive, you have to defeat all enemies by lowering their HP to 0 while keeping your own HP above 0.
At the start of your turn, you draw 5 cards. When you end your turn, all cards in your hand are discarded, unless the description of a card says otherwise.
You always have full MP at the start of your turn. You can spend MP to play cards that are in your hand by paying their MP cost.
Cards you play go to the discard pile unless the card description says otherwise. If you would draw a card but the draw pile is empty, the discard pile is reshuffled into a new draw pile, so cards you discarded before can be drawn again.
HP and MP are calculated in bytes (B), kilobytes (kB) and megabytes (MB). For example, dealing 500 B of damage to an enemy with 1.2 kB of HP will bring it down to 700 B.
If you or an enemy has block, damage is dealt to block instead of HP until block is consumed. For example, dealing 900 B of damage to an enemy with 600 B of HP and 400 B of block will leave the enemy with 100 B of health, as the 400 B of block reduce the actual damage dealt from 900 B to 500 B. Another attack of 100 B would defeat the enemy, since the previous attack has already consumed the block. If you still have block left at the start of your turn, it is removed, the same goes for enemies at the start of their turn.
There are four different card types: Attack, Defense, Tool and Trojan. Attack cards deal damage to enemies and defense cards apply block to protect you from damage. Tool cards don't deal damage or apply block, but have secondary effects that might be useful. Trojan cards are negative cards that enemies add to your deck, making it harder to draw your good cards. If you have MP to spare, you should play Trojan cards so they don't take up space in your deck.
